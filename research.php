      Classroom Trials & Research Findings
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to begin answering our research questions, we conducted three multiple-day trials in three classrooms in two schools in 2010-2011, and six multiple-day trials in four classrooms in two schools in 2011-2012. Each daily session lasted between 50 minutes and several hours. After each classroom trial, we continued to refine the software based on our observations and interviews with students and teachers.
      The trials for 2011-2012 are detailed below.
