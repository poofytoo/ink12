      Classroom Learning Partner
    </h2>
    <p>
      The software being used and extended in the INK-12 project is Classroom Learning Partner (CLP), a tablet-pc-based classroom interaction system first developed as part of the MIT-Microsoft iCampus effort: http://projects.csail.mit.edu/clp/about/, http://icampus.mit.edu/projects/project/?pname=CLP.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of CLP has always been to increase teacher-student interaction and student learning by supporting real-time use of student work created via a pen, and later touch, interface. It accomplishes this goal by means of the Create, Interpret, Share model of interaction: Students use a tablet pen to create representations. CLP interprets when possible the representations in order to provide the teacher with feedback about student understanding. It enables the teacher to filter and sort the representations based on CLP's interpretation and on her own assessment. The teacher then can select student work to share as a basis for class discussion and to identify students who may need help.

      CLP was used in introductory computer science and chemistry classes, and its interpretation routines focused on the use of "digital ink" in handwritten strings and sequences, in shaded and encircled regions, and sketched representations such as box-and-pointer (aka linked list) diagrams or chemical structures.

      CLP has been re-implemented to run on Lenovo X201 tablets, and more recently on the Microsoft Surface, with an eye toward a possible later port to Android devices. It is organized around the idea of an electronic notebook that contains lesson "pages". When using CLP in a classroom, students and teacher each have a tablet computer, and a tablet is connected to a projector. At the start of a lesson, students log in and are automatically connected to a wireless peer-to-peer network. They load the lesson's electronic notebook, which the teacher has created using an authoring system that has been implemented as part of CLP. Students work through the lesson—individually, in groups, or as a class— and wirelessly submit their responses, which appear on the teacher's machine, stored in a database on her machine. The teacher views student work, circulating through the classroom identifying students who need help. She also conducts class discussion focused on student work examples that she has selected and sent wirelessly to the projector to be displayed anonymously. 
      In the INK-12 project, the lessons focus on upper elementary math and science, and CLP's student tools include not only "digital ink" but also arrays (and variants such as factor cards and 10x10 grids), a division tool, and what we call stamps (and a variant called a collection stamp), which facilitate the creation of representations containing multiple identical images such as are often used in teaching multiplication and division to young students. The tools are accessible via a top command ribbon, as shown to the right in Figure 1. The notebook pages are accessible via the thumbnails shown on the left. The main display window shows the currently selected page.
